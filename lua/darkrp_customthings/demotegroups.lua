Demote groups
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
When a chief of police gets demoted you don't want them to be banned from becoming civil protection officer as well.
That is what demote groups are for.

When someone in a group is demoted, they will be banned from EVERY job in the group.
The examples shown below are the default demote groups

HOW TO CREATE A DEMOTE GROUP:
DarkRP.createDemoteGroup("Name of the group", {TEAM1, TEAM2})
---------------------------------------------------------------------------]]

DarkRP.createDemoteGroup("Polices", {TEAM_BRIGADIER, TEAM_BRIGADIER_CHEF, TEAM_BRIGADIER_CHEFPRINCIPAL})
DarkRP.createDemoteGroup("Gendarmes", {TEAM_GENDARME, TEAM_ADJUDANT, TEAM_ADJUDANT_CHEF, TEAM_MAJOR, TEAM_LIEUTENANT, TEAM_CAPITAINE, TEAM_COMMANDANT, TEAM_COLONELTEAM_GENDARME, TEAM_ADJUDANT, TEAM_ADJUDANT_CHEF, TEAM_MAJOR, TEAM_LIEUTENANT, TEAM_CAPITAINE, TEAM_COMMANDANT, TEAM_COLONELTEAM_GENDARME, TEAM_ADJUDANT, TEAM_ADJUDANT_CHEF, TEAM_MAJOR, TEAM_LIEUTENANT, TEAM_CAPITAINE, TEAM_COMMANDANT, TEAM_COLONELTEAM_GENDARME, TEAM_ADJUDANT, TEAM_ADJUDANT_CHEF, TEAM_MAJOR, TEAM_LIEUTENANT, TEAM_CAPITAINE, TEAM_COMMANDANT, TEAM_COLONEL})
